# zeno-py
Python code translated from existing IDL scripts, analysing and plotting Jupiter's X-ray aurora. As well as python scripts, the repository contains so far:
- User guide to help use the python scripts
- Chandra_horizons2000 files added for all observations to date (as of 13/11/18) - can be used for the scripts.

<b>Note</b>: .ipynb files are Jupyter python notebooks (which can be used using Anaconda) and .py files are the python scripts - both are identical.

Aims to be a public platform to share code/data/etc more easily.
